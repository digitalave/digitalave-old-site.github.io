### Install Docker on CentOS7 / Redhat RHEL7

##### Introduction

This is the very first session of Docker lesson series. In this tutorial I'm going to demonstrate how to install Docker on CentOS7 and RHEL7.



| Catagory | Requirements, Software Versions Used |
|----------|--------------------------------------|
| OS       | CentOS 7                          |
| Software | Docker Version 18                 |


Before the installation, We should know about little bit about Docker. 

1. What is Docker ?

2. Docker Editions ?

3. What is Docker Containers ?

4. Docker Installation on CentOS 8

##### What Docker ?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

* Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service.

* That use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages.
* They are called containers.

* These containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files
* They can communicate with each other.


* Docker turns your Computer into isolated containers which runs your codes or services independently. The single operating system carved up into isolated little spaces.


##### Overview of Docker editions:


**Docker is available in three Editions:**

<img src="/images/Docker-Installation/1.jpg" width="100%">

1. Docker Engine - Community Edition:** 

Good starting point for individual developers, small teams and those who are learning docker.

2. Docker Engine - Enterprise Edition:**

Designed for enterprise level development of docker containers with better enhanced security.

3. Docker Enterprise:**

Designed for enterprise development and IT teams who build, ship, and run business critical apps in production.

##### What is a Container ?

A self-contained sealed unit of software. It has everything in the container required to run the code.

A Single Container Includes:

1. Code 
2. Configs
3. Processes
4. Networking Services
5. All Dependencies for your code need to run
6. Operating System


<u>Supported Platforms</u>

##### Install Docker Engine - Community For CentOS 7 / RHEL 7

**OS requirements:**

`centos-extras` repository must be enable. This is enable by default on CentOS.

The `overlay2` storage driver is recommended.

### Install From Docker yum repository

**STEP 01: SETUP THE DOCKER YUM REPOSITORY**

Install required packages For YUM repository management.

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
```


Download and setup docker repository from docker.com

```bash
sudo yum-config-manager  --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```

Install docker package

```bash
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

**STEP 02: Start & Enable Docker Daemon** 
Once docker-ce installed on the system, we must start & enable the docker daemon. So, that it will be launched automatically on system boots.

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

**STEP 03: Verify Installation**
Now check whether docker has been installed correctly.

```bash
systemctl is-active docker
```

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

which automatically start to download basic "hello-world" images from Docker Hub. 

**STEP 04: Testing Docker**

Now, I'm going to build an image and run a container. In this case I'm going to use official "httpd". 

```bash
sudo docker run --rm --name=linuxconfig-test -p 80:80 httpd
```

Since the httpd image does not exists locally it will be automatically fetched and built. Finally, a container based on it will be launched in the foreground (it will be automatically removed when stopped). If our firewall is configured to allow access to port 80, we should be able to see the It works! message when we reach our machine ip via browser.


### Manage Docker as a non-root user:

If you donâ€™t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.

**STEP 01: Create The Docker Group:**

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

**STEP 02: Add User To Docker Group:**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
In here $USER automatically resolve current user logged in.

Now, You need to logout from $USER and log into $USER again.

$USER is the username which user wants to run without "sudo" prefix.

Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

**STEP 03: Configure Docker to Start on Boot:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Install Docker on Ubuntu/Debian 


**Install Docker Engine - Community** 

**A. Setup apt Repository**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```


**B. Install required Packages to Allow apt Repositories over HTTPS.**

```bash
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common
```

 
**C. Add Docker's GPG Key** 
 
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```


**D. Setup Docker Repository**

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
```

   
**E. Update apt Package Index Again**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```


**F. Install Docker Engine**

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```


**G. Verify The Docker Engine Installed Correctly**

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```


#### Post Installation - Manage Docker as a Non Root User

**A. Create a group  named "docker"**

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```


**B. Add User to the group named "docker"**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```


**C. Restart the Host Machine** 

```bash
reboot
```


**D. Verify the Docker Installation** 

```bash
docker run hello-world
```


**E. Docker Start on Boot**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Grate, Now Docker installation on CentOS / Ubuntu has been completed. Now, Lets start to get hands dirty...

Hope this helps for those who are looking for a starting point to learn Docker. I wish to teach more about Docker in the next lesson.
