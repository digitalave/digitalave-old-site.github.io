#### Install Docker Engine - Community For CentOS 8


**OS requirements:**


`centos-extras` repository must be enable. This is enable by default on centos.
The `overlay2` storage driver is recommended.


##### Install From Docker yum repository

**STEP 01: SETUP THE DOCKER YUM REPOSITORY**

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2
```


```bash
sudo yum-config-manager  --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
```


```bash
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```


**STEP 02: Start Docker Service** 

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

**STEP 03: Verify Installation**

Verify Docker Engine - Community is installed correctly.

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

> 2. Install from a package
> 
> https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/
> 
> sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm
> 

#### Manage Docker as a non-root user:

If you donâ€™t want to preface the docker command with sudo, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the Docker daemon starts, it creates a Unix socket accessible by members of the docker group.

**STEP 01: Create The Docker Group:**


```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

**STEP 02: Add User To Docker Group:**

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

$USER is the username which user wants to run without "sudo" prefix.

Verify that you can run docker commands without sudo

```bash
docker run hello-world
```


STEP 03: Configure Docker to Start on Boot:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
